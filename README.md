Creates an HR control system for a given company.

Employees have an endpoint to login for daily attendance. Salaries are calculated based on attendance.

The HR manager account has an endpoint to login on the 30th of each month to pay the salaries for the employees of the company.
An individual review is possible, but salaries are paid all at once.

The salaries payment can only be done on the 30th of each month. After the payments are done, the payment history is kept on 
the database, and it is possible to retrieve individual payments for a given year of a given month.
